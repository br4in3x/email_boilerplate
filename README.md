# Email template boilerplate

This project can help you to kick start an email template layout. 

Templates located at `/templates` folder, and each template has it's own .css file. Change the template layout and css file, and run `npm run build` command to get your email template built with css inlined.

Alternatively, you can run `npm start` command to see your changes in browser. While `npm start` is running, open the template file from `build` folder in the browser and modify files within this folder. To see your changes reload the browser.
